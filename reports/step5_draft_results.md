## Descriptive Statistics

Table 1 presents descriptive statistics for the seven major personality scales across 23,647 participants. Sample sizes varied across scales due to the planned missingness design, with Big Five scales having the largest samples (N = 23,357 to 23,437) and composite scales having smaller samples (Ideology: N = 11,825; Honesty-Humility: N = 12,828). This variation reflects the fact that composite scales require valid data on all component scales, which reduces the available sample size.

Mean scores for Big Five scales ranged from 3.35 (Neuroticism) to 4.31 (Openness), with standard deviations ranging from 0.82 (Agreeableness) to 0.98 (Neuroticism). As expected, Ideology and Honesty-Humility showed means near zero (M = 0.00, SD = 0.98 and M = 0.00, SD = 0.74, respectively) because they are computed as averages of standardized scores.

*Descriptive Statistics for Seven Major Personality Scales*

| Scale | N | M | SD |
|-------|---|---|-----|
| Openness | 23,399 | 4.31 | 0.83 |
| Conscientiousness | 23,417 | 4.23 | 0.86 |
| Extraversion | 23,357 | 3.87 | 0.92 |
| Agreeableness | 23,437 | 4.23 | 0.82 |
| Neuroticism | 23,371 | 3.35 | 0.98 |
| Ideology | 11,825 | 0.00 | 0.98 |
| Honesty-Humility | 12,828 | 0.00 | 0.74 |

*Note.* Ideology and Honesty-Humility are composite scales computed as averages of standardized component scores, which explains their means near zero.

## Correlations Among Scales

Figure 1 presents the correlation matrix among the seven personality scales. The strongest positive correlation was observed between Agreeableness and Honesty-Humility (r = .79), suggesting a strong positive association that may reflect conceptual overlap between these constructs. The strongest negative correlation was between Openness and Ideology (r = -.57), indicating that openness is associated with more progressive (less conservative) ideological views.

Other notable correlations included Conscientiousness with Honesty-Humility (r = .27), Conscientiousness with Agreeableness (r = .19), and negative correlations between Extraversion and Neuroticism (r = -.24) and between Conscientiousness and Neuroticism (r = -.23). These patterns are consistent with theoretical expectations from the Big Five and HEXACO models of personality.

## State-Level Differences

We identified 8 statistically significant state-level features (|CR| > 3.0, p < .003) across 9 states and 7 personality scales (see Figure 2). Michigan showed the most distinctive profile, with significantly higher scores on Honesty-Humility (CR = 4.31) and Agreeableness (CR = 3.34), but significantly lower scores on Openness (CR = -3.22). New York showed significantly higher Openness (CR = 3.87), and Illinois showed significantly higher Extraversion (CR = 3.65).

Florida showed significantly lower Neuroticism (CR = -3.22), suggesting lower levels of emotional instability in this sample. California showed significantly lower Honesty-Humility (CR = -3.21) and Ideology (CR = -3.11), indicating more progressive ideological orientation and lower scores on the Honesty-Humility composite.

These findings suggest statistically significant regional variation in personality traits that may be related to cultural, economic, or historical factors. However, alternative explanations, such as selective migration patterns or sampling biases inherent in online recruitment, cannot be ruled out. We note that these differences are relative to the grand mean across all analyzed states and should be interpreted in the context of the overall sample characteristics.
